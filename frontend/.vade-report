# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

## Summary
Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for the Next.js App Router project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/analytics` version 1.6.1 using npm
- Updated `package.json` to include the new dependency
- Updated `package-lock.json` with the new package and its dependencies (381 packages added)

### 2. Analytics Component Integration
Modified `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`:
- Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/next'`
- Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, placed after `{children}` component
- Preserved all existing code structure, fonts, metadata, and the ClientCursor component

### 3. Verification
- ✅ Build completed successfully (npm run build) - no errors
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passed
- ✅ All 11 routes generated successfully
- ✅ Linter ran successfully (no new errors introduced)
- ✅ No tests available to run (project has no test script configured)

### 4. Git Staging
Staged the following files:
- `package.json` - Added @vercel/analytics dependency
- `package-lock.json` - Updated with new dependencies
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added Analytics component

## Implementation Details

The project uses Next.js 16.1.6 with App Router architecture. The Analytics component was added to the root layout (`app/layout.tsx`) following Vercel's recommended pattern for App Router projects.

The component is placed at the end of the `<body>` tag, which is the standard location for analytics scripts to ensure they don't block page rendering. The implementation is minimal and non-intrusive, requiring only:
1. One import statement
2. One self-closing component tag

## Notes

- The Analytics component will automatically track page views and Web Vitals metrics
- No additional configuration is required for basic analytics functionality
- Analytics data will be available in the Vercel dashboard once the application is deployed to Vercel
- The component is designed to work seamlessly in both development and production environments
- Some pre-existing linting warnings and errors exist in the project (50 total: 26 errors, 24 warnings), but none are related to the Analytics implementation
